# Image browser

The image browser is a tool to browse and manage images on your system.

## How to use

::: info
If you open this page before you generate any images, you will see a blank page.
:::

On your right side is a panel with a list of images. You can click on an image to see it in the preview panel.
You can also switch the mode from `Txt2Img` to `Img2Img` or `Extra`. All images should be separated correctly into these categories.

Once you click on an image, you can see the image in the preview panel. You can also see all the image metadata in the bottom panel (metadata are taken from tEXt properties).
