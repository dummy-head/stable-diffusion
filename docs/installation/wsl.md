## How to start the application after closing it

I have an easier way planned for the future, but for now, you'll have to run the following commands every time you want to start the application.
:::

1. Launch Ubuntu from the Start Menu
2. `cd voltaML-fast-stable-diffusion` (or wherever you cloned the repository)
3. `source venv/bin/activate`
4. `python main.py`
